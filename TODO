# Major
* Update meal's nutritional values
* Deal with failures for the meals resource
* Write a Dockerfile to wrap the server
* How do we pass the API-Ninja API Key to the docker?
* Deal with the effect of deleting dishes on meals that already exist

# Minor
* Deal with request headers
* Deal with badly formatted JSON input (See slide 14)
* Deal with non-JSON input


# Extra
* Pytest
* Separate to different modules (separate 'data' classes from REST implementation)
* Uniformity with _ prefix
* Type hints
* Remove any 'TODO'
* Removed unnecessary comments

# Questions
* Indexing of dishes. Can we reuse the same index?
* Am I using the 'subresources' correctly?
